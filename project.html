        <h3 style="color: aliceblue;">Overview</h3>
        <p style="width: 900px;color: aliceblue;">The project will focus on creating a centralized and targeted workplace social education application, targeting public members who are looking to gain more perspective and advice before entering a field of work, simulations of work environment problems and educating ethical and moral solutions. In order to achieve this, we need to concentrate many experienced veterans and summarize their experiences and advice to create live sessions and record lessons to educate social newcomers about their workplace. Sessions will be divided according to a personality and goal test allowing individuals to find the class that best suits their needs. Professional planners will also help users analyze their advantages and disadvantages within different career paths. There are also free career stimulations that users can use to experience and explore before deciding what path they want to follow.</p>

      <div class="row" style="width:1200px; margin:auto auto;">
        <h3 style="color: aliceblue;">Motivation</h3>
        <p style="width: 900px;color: aliceblue;">I Started developing this idea during my high school years; I was contemplating between different career options, uncertain about what profession would best suit me and what my future workplace would look like. I was confused and clueless about what the road ahead looked like. To be honest, I felt the units I studied in high school didn’t help me profession wise. I had no enthusiasm and motivation for the normal high school coursesI wanted to learn some more practical skills that could enhance my ability. I couldn’t stop questioning, why weren't there any organizations that were offering programs teaching practical social work ethics, when we had more than enough resources and technology to create one? Hence, I want to fill this gaping hole in the market myself.

    <div class="about_section layout_padding">
    	<div class="container">
        
    		<div class="row">
          <center>
    			<div class="col-md-6">
    				<div class="about_taital">
    					<div class="about_text"><span style="color: #c6610f;">Description</span></div>
    					<p class="dolor_text">Compared with other mobile education apps, this app has the advantage of being highly targeted and analytical, with concentrated and high-quality educational resources. First of all, it is in the concentration compared with other software, other existing workplace education resources and advertisements on the market are scattered on major websites, social accounts and other mobile apps that do not specialize in producing educational videos. Or they only exist on specialized types of applications, such as English dictionary-type applications with only English education courses. Users with workplace education needs get relatively fragmented and confusing information, and they don't know which is the best and most professional choice.</br></p>
              <p class="dolor_text">So, to solve this problem on our software will include most of the most common career courses in the society, we will invite very experienced career veterans in various fields, as well as people who want to do career courses but can't find a suitable platform to develop quality courses on our app. The centralized and targeted quality courses will save users' time of slowly searching and screening courses on other websites and apps. Once the courses are entered, they can be sold repeatedly to achieve once and many times more revenue, and also bring more revenue to the App platform and course instructors.</br></p>
              <p class="dolor_text">There are also smaller courses that are not specific to a particular career that can be developed on the platform. For example, we can publish some courses to improve communication skills in the workplace, interpersonal relationship management, image enhancement, photography hobby development, etc. Because some small skillful knowledge will help us to develop better in our respective workplace. But these tips are generally difficult to learn systematically in school and in the workplace. These courses are relatively inexpensive and short, but the rewards can be very surprising.
              </br></br>
                The second major advantage is that it is highly targeted. Before starting to use the software, users will be asked to take a personality test and a hobby test, and our system will give suggestions to tell them what kind of jobs they are suitable for based on their personality preferences. In addition, there are free experience courses that simulate the workplace environment available. First, it allows users to know more about themselves so that they can choose the workplace course they want to learn most. Of course, we will also have professional career analysts to give more detailed career planning solutions based on the user's personality analysis test results and their preferences. This saves users valuable time of trial and error in life and avoids the painful struggle of being in a job market that is not suitable for them from the very beginning.
              </br></br>
                I think only individual course learning is not enough. Because it is not an offline physical course, users without a physical learning environment are likely to forget to study on time and their questions may not be solved in time. Therefore, our community and forum operations must be well-served. We will set up two chat groups on WeChat or other social software. One is a learning exchange group, where users who study the same course will gather together to exchange experiences and learn from each other. In the group, a supervisor will be arranged to explain the key knowledge points of the day and answer questions, and three assistants will be arranged to maintain the discipline of the group and remind users to study the course every day. The other group is a banned speaking and material group, users do not need to communicate in the group. The assistants will organize all the knowledge points of the day into a document form in the evening and release it in the banned speaking and material group. It is convenient for users who don't have time to pay attention to the communication group to make up for the lessons in the evening to learn more efficiency. In addition, there will be an open forum on application for all users to communicate on infield issues. Usually, there will be career planners in the group to answer questions. If a user answers a question for them, they will also be rewarded with a coupon that can be used to get a discount on other courses. The platform itself also regularly publishes professional career analysis articles and real-time hot topics on the forum.
              </br></br>
                Finally, the app will also include a shopping platform to sell some things that may be used in work and study. For example, crafting, which I am good at, involves a lot of scattered material packages. It would really waste a lot of time and energy to spend time to collect, organize and purchase. Our shopping platform will provide tools and materials for careers that require tools, such as those mentioned in crafting courses and baking courses. Books and materials mentioned in other vocational courses can also be purchased on the shopping platform. Likewise, to attract users to shop on the platform instead of going to other shopping platforms, we will offer rewards of shopping points in exchange for course coupons.

    					<p class="dolor_text">Developing a perfect software is not an easy task. It is impossible for one person to accomplish it. Therefore, we needed to find an ideal team to work with. The creation of this mobile application required the collaboration of a product manager, UI designer, interaction designer, development engineer, test engineer, product operation and project manager. Most importantly, for an educational software, we need to find some workplace seniors who have work experience and can record classes for our software. In terms of hardware, I don't know much about it at the moment. But the cost of this can be quite high and requires the establishment of a server room, consisting of server racks, computer servers, routers, etc. to run the software company.
                </br>
              </p>
    					<div class="about_text"><span style="color: #c6610f;">Skills Required</span></div>
    					<p class="dolor_text">In order to start a software company, we need people who can program first. My current undergraduate major and programming courses will help me a lot in the future. However, according to my personality test analysis. I am passionate and idealistic most of the time. I like to work with people, which requires communication and thinking. So, I prefer to be in charge of development and operations and leave the backend programming and testing to other more professional people. While operating in the front office, I may also develop some craft courses and use my work to help develop my hobby.
              </br>
            </p>
              <div class="about_text"><span style="color: #c6610f;">Outcomes</span></div>
              <p class="dolor_text">If this project is successful, there will be more quality instructors and courses flowing into our platform. More technical support will be needed, and more people will be needed to keep the community and forum running. This also means that the investment and labor cost will get bigger and bigger in the later years. At that time, we will also need more professional accountants to handle the company's finances and business data analysts to help managers make decisions. Although we may face many problems and investment risks in the later stage. But I am still full of expectation for this project. I hope that through this education app, more and more people will realize the importance of learning and also learn any course they are interested in without any restriction of education. Users can enjoy the fun of learning, and the direct result of learning and job and salary improvement is our biggest purpose of this educational software.
